			<p>Kurt Vonnegut Jr. is an American fiction and science fiction author. Throughout his fifty year career he published 14 novels, three short story collections, five plays, and five works of non-fiction. He is famous for his dark and satrical writing style and his most popular novel <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i>, which gained popularity both from its time on the <i>New York Times</i> best seller list and by being banned in schools accross the country.</p>
			<p> Vonnegut was born on November 11, 1922, in Indianpolis, Indiana. He is the son of Kurt Sr. and Edith Vonnegut and the youngest of three children. When he was 20 years old he joined the army, fought in the Battle of the Bulge, and was captured by the Germans. He was sent as a POW to Dresden, which was bombed during his time there. Vonnegut and his fellow POWs survived becasue they were being housed three stories underground in a former meat locker in a slaughter house. This incident would serve as inspiration to his most well known novel.</p>
			<p>After the war, Vonnegut returned home to Indianapolis and married his wife Jane Cox; they later had three children, which encouraged Vonnegut to get published and support his family. In 1953 his first novel <i>Player Piano</i> was published.</p>
			<p>Vonnegut's sister Alice died of cancer in 1957, just two days after her husband died in a freak train accident. Vonnegut adopted Alice's three children as his own, doubling the size of his family and further increasing his need to get published. During the next 10 years he published several novels.</p>
			<p>After his children grew up and left home, Vonnegut's marriage to his wife Jane fell apart, and they got divorced in 1972. He soon became depressed and suffered writer's block, and the disintegration of families became a major theme in a few of his novels, such as <i>Breakfast of Champions</i> and <i>Slapstick</i>.</p>
			<p>In the late 1970's Vonnegut met and married his second wife photographer Jill Krementz.</p>
			<p>Kurt Vonnegut died on April 11, 2007, from brain injuries after falling on the steps of his New York brownstone.</p>
